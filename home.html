         <p><b>Today, the role of a school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower its students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an ever-changing global society. 
           More than a decade back Saffron pledged to transform education. 
           The school that is being run under the aegis of well established Management “City Educational Trust” has earned its own niche not only in Phagwara but across the globe.
            At CIty Academy we provide an atmosphere to our students for multifaceted development, where children are encouraged to channelize their potential in the pursuit of excellence.
            This can only be possible in a holistic, student-centric environment. 
            The talents, skills, and abilities of each student need to be identified, nurtured, and encouraged so that he / she is able to reach greater heights. 
            Students need to be provided with a platform to think, express, and exhibit their skills. It is necessary to empower them to negotiate several issues that confront them, with the teacher being a facilitator.  

            The school is striving hard to make the best possible efforts to inculcate strong values combining with academics and extra-curricular activities in the children.
             Converting every individual into a self-reliant and independent citizen, the school provides an amalgam of scholastic and co-scholastic activities.
             No wonder, a student harnessed in such an atmosphere has every hope and possibility of becoming a responsible, balanced and a mature adult and is able to live in to contribute and to shoulder responsibilities of the society, of which he forms an integral part. Children need a supportive environment at home and at school. 
             They need to set goals, within their reach until they gain confidence and determination.</b> </p>

         <p><b>While academic excellence is our major thrust, the school is also devoted to prepare the students for life, groom them to face the challenges of tomorrow, and encourage them to be socially relevant. We constantly endeavour to always live up to this ideology and inculcate this into everything we do, with the aim that we will be able to ensure that the children grow to their full potential, while constantly being groomed to pass out as men and women competent to bear responsibility in all walks of life.

          The parents are the most strengthening power in moulding the future of children. Their consistent support empowers us to do more and more. I pay my gratitude to them for their faith in us. 
          
          I am confident enough that the Saffronians will make themselves stronger day by day, adding a new leaf to the grandeur of the school.

         The “invention” of the playground in general is not attributed to any one person but rather is viewed as a development and combination of the ideas of many thinkers who wrote on education and play—including John Amos Comenius, John Locke, Johann Bernhard Basedow, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Friedrich Froebel, John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and Arnold Gesell.
